<h1>Universe</h1>      
<h2>Stars</h2>      
<p class='p'>  It is hard to comprehend the enormity of our Universe.     
               Our Sun is only one of billions of stars in our galaxy, known as the Milky Way.          
               But beyond the Milky Way, there are billions of other galaxies, too.           
               collectively, all these galaxies, along with the vast amount of space found in between them, 
               are called the Universe.</p></br>                        
<p class='p2'>A star is a sphere of gas held together by its own gravity.       
             The closest star to Earth is our very own Sun. </p><br>
